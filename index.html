              <p>Fuse is a character from a fps game called Apex
              Legends. Apex legends is a battle royale game that
              has a high skill ceiling and the journey to the top
              is fun (sometimes frustrating, but mostly fun).His 
              abilities allow him to actively engage and attack 
              other players instead of lying low and playing defensive
              (This depends on player style - I personally enjoy
              taking an active role on my team).<br><br><hr>

                <p>Collosus is a character from the game X-men. Through out
                the years, there have been several releases of the X-Men 
                game, so I'm sure everyone here is familiar with Colossus.
                I personally played him when I was still rocking the 
                Playstation 2. Shootig at, or attacking Collosus won't do much
                damage with his ability. Run! <br><br><br><hr>

                Back again with another PS2 game I really enjoyed called Ratchet & Clank.
                This game was a feel good action-adventure game that was just fun to play. 
                To be honest, sometimes I didn't even know what was happening but one thing
                I do know is that is was fun! The game creaters recently rebooted the game
                  with a newer version called Ratchet & Clank Rift Apart. All the gadgets 
                  and utilities will have you missing work for weeks so I suggest you be 
                  careful. <br><hr>

                Finally, we have Luigi from Super Mario. Super Mario is a platform game
                that most people have played. I love this game because it's very simple
                  yet intruguing and fun. As to why I like Luigi more than Mario, uhmm..... I 
                  really don't know, I just do. All playable characters play the exact
                  same role and have no different in ability, but Luigi just does it for
                    me. <br><br><br><hr>

                  None. Just make sure you eat the mushroom and flower.
